# 100 days of python
Here I'll be uploading my Angela Yu's 100 days of code files.


## Day 21. Snake Game.

I decided to do one day per week, to have time to study react and other stuff. I also decided to start writting, to get track of the proccess.

I didn't learn anything new, but I understood better how classes work and about inheritance. Also I was able to eliminate some duplicate code. Making the snake game also was fun, as someone that actually played that game a lot.
