# 100 days of python
Here I'll be uploading my Angela Yu's 100 days of code files.


### Day 20 and 21. Snake Game.

I decided to do one exercise per week, in order to have time to study react and other code things. I also decided to start writing a bit after every exercise, to get track of the process.

Today I didn't learn anything new, but I understood better how classes work and about inheritance. Also I was able to eliminate some duplicate code. Making the snake game also was fun, as someone that actually played that game a lot.

### Day 22. Pong Game

We are still using the turtle module and we used that to make the [pong game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong). We made a main.py game and a ball, paddle and scoreboard classes. Today I just followed the instructions of the exercise, but I tried to go always one step ahead so I can see if my logic is right.

I am feeling pretty confident about classes and inheritance is making more sense.
